## Project Description
In this project, we aim to provide a solution to time-dependent travel salesman problem (TD-TSP). In the classical TSP, the time window is constant, which can lead to an inaccurate calculation. In TD-TSP, the time windows arenâ€™t constant and will vary throughout the day. We aim to analyse the effect of travel times on the TSP problem and we hope to provide a more realistic solution to the TSP problem that reflects on real-world traffic conditions.

<summary>&ensp;<b>Result</b></summary>

- After all of the parameters are filled, the visualizer will work by performing the algorithm step-by-step.

- The summary in the right summarizes all the graph weight, node cost, and congestion that is generated randomly or based on the user input.

- The output in the right summarizes what the visualizer is doing right now. Lastly, it will also display the minimum cost and optimal path.
